## 8. Example Post (Reusable)
AI does not fail because the model is weak.  
It fails because the workflow is weak.

Most companies bolt AI onto isolated systems and expect transformation. That never works.

A cognitive enterprise acts differently. It remembers. It reasons. It executes. It connects every conversation, system, and decision into one coordinated process.

Krista outperforms task bots because it orchestrates outcomes across systems.
